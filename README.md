# Torus-Tetris

Torus Tetris is a fun twist on the classic game Tetris. Unlike traditional Tetris where pieces fall straight down, in Torus Tetris, the pieces fall towards the torus surface. The goal is to rotate the pieces so that they fit together and form a complete ring. If the pieces stack up too high and fill the torus, then it's game over!
